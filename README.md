# radio-transmitter

This sketch is the firware for a radio transmitter based on transceiver module nRF24L01. The controller has 2 input pads, one with 4 push buttons, and the other with 2 push buttons, resulting in 6 digital inputs. All 6 inputs are treated as channels and transmitted to the receiver independently. The board used is an Arduino Nano.
